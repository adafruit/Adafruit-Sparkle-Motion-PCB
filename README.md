### Description

* Power via USB Type C PD with a slide switch that selects between 5, 12, and 20V (24V pixels can usually run fine at 20V) OR via a 2.1mm DC jack. With ideal diodes, it’s good for up to 5A from either.
* ESP32-Mini module with built-in or optional wFL antenna port. The classic ’32 has broad support, even if we’d prefer the ‘S2 or ‘S3.
* There are three output signal terminal block sets, with power and ground for each. They’ll be level-shifted to 5V.
* Built in I2S microphone (we’re still pondering this one).
* Stemma QT I2C port to connect external sensors/OLEDs/etc.; separate analog/digital input JST port.
* 1.3″x1.75″ / 33mm x 45mm size with mounting holes.
